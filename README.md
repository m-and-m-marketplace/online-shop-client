![hero-home](./public/images/hero-home.png)

## Description
This is the frontend of our online shop. We used create-react-app to create the React application und we used Bootstrap to style the app. The frontend displays the information from the [backend server](https://mm-online-shop.adaptable.app/), which is an Express API that we created.

## Instructions
To run this app on your computer, start by forking and cloning this repo and enter the following commands:

```
$ cd online-shop-client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Demo
The app has two types of users:
- admin
- customer
If you sign up, you will automatically be a customer, with the ability to create orders. The admin has extra functionality to create, update and delete products.
To test admin functionality, you can use the following account:
- Email: admin@admin.com
- Password: Password1
